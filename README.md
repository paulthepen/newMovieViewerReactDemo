# Movie Search w/ React

This is a simple single page application meant to be a showcase for several concepts:

1. React Development abilities
2. Development from a Figma design
3. API utilization
4. Tailwinds CSS utilization

The Figma design for this app was taken from a JS Course found at [JS Mastery](https://jsmastery.com/video-kit/dd0f1153-ba7f-44c9-a450-0acdb954902b).

The design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/OMdrZksFOvzgAD7hbJ5OIa/Movie-App-w_-React?node-id=2-2&p=f&t=L2pF24949cVOJ7cK-0)

This app additionally uses Appwrite's API to store the "trending movies" section.
